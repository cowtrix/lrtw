Narlang (Narrative Language) is a markup language for generating documents. It was designed as a tool to assist in the composition of long, complex documents, specifically novels. Its purpose is to combine many of the features of a code language with general document production.

This came out of a rejection of the plethora of WYSIWYG document editors, towards something more like LaTeX â€“ but with a few more fancy features that programmers are used to like symbol recognition and semantics.

This project is a WIP. More versions soon I hope!
