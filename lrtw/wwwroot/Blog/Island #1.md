Sometimes, I dream of places. When the memories of those places persist after I wake, sometimes I want to try and create them. I dreamed this place a long, long time ago, but it has stayed with me since. White walls like Mykonos, but with arched roofs. Stairs, flight after flight leading up to the refuge above the waves. A boat rocking gently at the dock. Seagulls in the sky. You can find a poor and miserable recreation of that memory below. Music is by [Drakensson](https://freesound.org/people/Drakensson/).
