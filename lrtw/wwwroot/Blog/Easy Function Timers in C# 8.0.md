A function timer is a class that can monitor the execution of functions and time them. If youâ€™ve got some upper limit on how long a function should take then these timers can be very useful in detecting drops in performance.

With C# 8.0, you get some nice features that allow for a nice little function timer class, namely:

Inline using statements, which let you declare IDisposable objects in a using statement without using braces and just use the scope of the declaring function. This is absolutely perfect for a function timer! We can inline declare an object that will be cleaned up when the function leaves scope (with 1 or 2 tricky edge cases, of courseâ€¦)

Discards, introduced in C# 7.0, also mean we donâ€™t have to bring any local variables into play when we create this using variable! This is great because it means the function actually canâ€™t mess around with its timer object, while still being able to use the scope.

Thereâ€™s a few other nice little tools we can use â€“ CallerMemberNameAttribute lets us grab the calling method name in a performant way.

So, check this out:

```
public class FunctionTimer : IDisposable
{
	private string m_memberName;
	private TimeSpan m_maxTime;
	private Stopwatch m_stopwatch;
	private bool m_isDisposed;

	public FunctionTimer(TimeSpan maxTime, [CallerMemberName] string memberName = "")
	{
		m_maxTime = maxTime;
		m_stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
		m_memberName = memberName;
	}

	public void Dispose()
	{
		if (m_isDisposed)
		{
			return;
		}
		m_isDisposed = true;
		if (m_stopwatch.Elapsed > m_maxTime)
		{
			Console.WriteLine($"Warning: Long running function: {m_memberName}. {m_stopwatch.Elapsed} - expected max {m_maxTime}");
			// Debugger.Break();
 - can even break the debugger here if you'd like for further investigation
		}
	}
}
```

So, how do you use it?

```
void MyMaybeLongRunningFunction()
{
    using var _ = new FunctionTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
    /* . . .
    Do some things which need to happen within a certain timeframe
    . . . */
}  // When the callstack collapses, the function timer will dispose and the timer will get checked
```

You can even use it with brackets to time portions of a method:

```
void MyMaybeLongRunningFunction()
{
    using (var _ = new FunctionTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)))
    {
        /* do the thing */
    } // timer gets checked here
}
```

Note that there are some weird things that happen when you depend on scope cleanup for function timing, especially around try/catch/finally blocks. For instance:

```
void MyFunction()
{
	using var _ = new FunctionTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
	try
	{
		// do a thing that maybe throws an exception
	}
	catch (Exception e)	// timer stops as we enter the catch
	{
		// So exception cleanup time isn't counted
	}
	finally
	{
		// We might then do a finally block that maybe takes some time - but this won't be counted either!
	}
	// But note - this only happens if the method ends here! Optimisation I guess?
}
```

Interesting stuff! Now go time your functions easier than ever ðŸ™‚
